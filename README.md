I use notepad all the time, sometimes I just wanted to add one little feature, but it’s not extendable so I can’t. If I could just get my hands on the source code and if that source code was in C# I’d be set. So I decided to write a clone so I can do just that, and share it so that others could as well.

I attempted to make an exact clone and I think I did pretty good with three exceptions. One I decided I wanted a different icon so I can tell it apart from the actual notepad. Two, the real notepad has header and footer information as part of the page setup. I didn’t know how to do that since the page setup dialog is a system dialog. And three I didn’t try to duplicate the windows notepad help file.
